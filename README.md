4. Winner's Circle (Board Game) Strategy Analysis

The goal of this project was to determine the best horses to bet on and devise a stratgey for the board game Winner's Circle. I entered all of the horse cards in the game into a csv with the length of each horses run depending on the dice roll. I wrote a program to simulate a round of Winner's Circle taking into account the rules and restrictions of the game, ran it 100,000 times to simulate the game, and calculated win percentages for every horse in the game. I then investigated whether the difference in win percentage between horses is statistically significant and what features correlate with a high win percentage.

5. Into the Wild Trips Analysis

Ongoing project for my role within the student outdoors organization as data analyst. Perform data entry, cleaning, and visualization to create yearly trip reports and  analysis for Santa Clara University's student run outdoors organization, Into the Wild. In this project, using data that I collected and entered, I create visualizations and utilize other techniques to explore our organization's trip sales and factors preventing trips filling for both day hikes and overnight camping trips during the past school year. The questions I explore in this position include but are not limited to the following:

1. What are the most important factors that affect trip sign ups? (For both day hikes and overnights)
2. Are Friday overnights more popular/likely to fill than Saturday overnights?
3. How are trip sales affected by the quarter (Fall, Winter, Spring)?
4. What locations are in demand (trips we should run again) and which are not (trips we won't run again)?
5. How do sign up numbers vary with type of trip (car camping, backpacking, beach)?
