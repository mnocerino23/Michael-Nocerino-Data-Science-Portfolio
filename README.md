4. Winner's Circle (Board Game) Strategy Analysis

In this project, I perform feature engineering and analysis to determine the best horses to bet on in the board game Winner's Circle. I wrote a program to simulate a round of Winner's Circle, ran it 100,000 times to simulate the game, and calculated win percentages for every horse in the game. I then investigated whether the difference in win percentage between horses is statistically significant and what features correlate with a high win percentage.
