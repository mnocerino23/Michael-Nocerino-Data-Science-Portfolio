3. Spotify Hip Hop/Rap Song Popularity Classifier

In this project, I use a machine learning approach to build a binary classifier that predicts whether a song will be popular depending on factors such as the track’s artist (artist popularity and number of followers on the Spotify app) and various features that describe the audio profile of the track such as energy, acousticness, . As the features that contribute to the popularity of a song vary from genre to genre, I decided to restrict my attention to the hip hop/rap genre for the purposes of this project. Hip-hop/rap is also one of the most stylistically diverse genres with many subgenres so I deemed it an interesting genre to explore. For this project, I start with a dataset of Spotify tracks obtained from Kaggle titled tracks.csv which comes directly from Spotify (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yamaerenay/ spotify -dataset-19212020-600k-tracks ). I scrape additional data from the Spotify API using Python's Spotipy and Pandas libraries. I utilize Spotify’s API in conjunction with Python's Pandas and Seaborn to perform data cleaning, preprocessing, and visualization. Finally, I utilize ML techniques such as logistic regression, k-nearest-neighbors, and support vector machine modeling to build classifiers for the popularity of a hip/hop rap song.

5. Winner's Circle (Board Game) Strategy Analysis

In this project, I perform feature engineering and analysis to determine the best horses to bet on in the board game Winner's Circle. I wrote a program to simulate a round of Winner's Circle, ran it 100,000 times to simulate the game, and calculated win percentages for every horse in the game. I then investigated whether the difference in win percentage between horses is statistically significant and what features correlate with a high win percentage.
