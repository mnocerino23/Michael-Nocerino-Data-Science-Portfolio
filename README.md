4. Winner's Circle (Board Game) Strategy Analysis

The goal of this project was to determine the best horses to bet on and devise a stratgey for the board game Winner's Circle. I entered all of the horse cards in the game into a csv with the length of each horses run depending on the dice roll. I wrote a program to simulate a round of Winner's Circle taking into account the rules and restrictions of the game, ran it 100,000 times to simulate the game, and calculated win percentages for every horse in the game. I then investigated whether the difference in win percentage between horses is statistically significant and what features correlate with a high win percentage.
