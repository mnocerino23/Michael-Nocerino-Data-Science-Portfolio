# Michael-Nocerino-Data-Science-Portfolio


About Me:
My name is Michael Nocerino, and I am a rising senior at Santa Clara University in Northern California majoring in Math (Data Science Emphasis) and minoring in Computer Science. I have an analytical background with strong exposure to probability and statistics, discrete math, programming in Python and C++, data mining, visualization, and supervised machine learning from the program at SCU thus far.

The first two data science courses I took my junior year provided a glimpse into the powerful applications of machine learning algorithms and left me feeling extremely motivated to explore the subject in more depth. From self-learning in my free time during this spring and summer, I have added additional skills such as SQL, Tableau, and the fundamentals of deep learning, developing these skills through a variety of data science projects which required me to learn on the fly as I completed the various tasks step by step. 

This summer I primarily worked on a research project through SCU in which I explored wildfire trends (from 2001-2019) in the state of California and attempted to analyze trends as well as predict high risk areas experimenting with multi-class classification (KNN, SVM, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Neural Networks) and regression (Linear, Ridge, Lasso, Neural Networks, and Decision Tree) machine learning techniques. I also worked on a variety of personal projects involving topics such as Major League Baseball salary prediction, board game strategy, and analyzing student engagement data within the hiking club I'm involved in at Santa Clara. Having to learn new Python libraries, programming languages, technologies, and techniques on my own along the way has been rewarding, and I have thoroughly enjoyed the process and growing my knowledge outside of the classroom through online content such as LinkedIn Learning and YouTube series.

My personal interests include nature and the outdoors, sports (MLB, NBA, and skateboarding) and environmental issues and it's been extremely fascinating to explore questions related to these interests through a data lens. Since this past spring, I have been hooked on using Python, visualization tools, and machine learning to explore questions that fascinate me. My goal is to apply my curiosity and passion for analytics to help provide valuable data driven insight to an organization helping guide business decisions in a data science, data analyst, or related role after college. Below, I provide summaries of the project's I have been working on over the past few month and some visuals from each.


1. California Wildfire Forecaster


Technologies used: SQL (SQLite), Python (Matplotlib, Pandas, Regular Expression, Requests, Scikit-Learn, Seaborn, TensorFlow), Tableau


2. Major League Baseball Player Salary Prediction

Personal project in which I explore player stats with the goal of building models to predict player worth (in millions) for pitchers and hitters in Major League Baseball. Cleaned two datasets, one with pitcher stats and one with position player hitting stats, in Pandas and created visualizations in Seaborn to understand the distributions of various stats throughout the league in addition to the features that correlate with high salary. I trained machine learning models with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow to predict player salary for position players, pitchers, starting pitchers, and relief pitchers utilizing multivariate linear, ridge, lasso, decision tree and neural network regression techniques. Utilized techniques such as cross validation and tuning of model parameters with grid search.

3. Into the Wild Trips Analysis

Ongoing project for my role within the student outdoors organization as data analyst. Perform data entry, cleaning, and visualization to create yearly trip reports and  analysis for Santa Clara University's student run outdoors organization, Into the Wild. For this role, using data that I collected and entered, I create visualizations and utilize other techniques to explore our organization's trip sales and factors preventing trips filling for both day hikes and overnight camping trips during the past school year. In addition to crafting visualizations and programming to answer questions regarding student engagement with the organization, I also improved the organizations data collection by creating new google forms so that we can efficiently collect trip and participant going forward. The questions I explore in this position include but are not limited to the following:

1. What are the most important factors that affect trip sign ups for both day hikes and overnights?
2. Are Friday overnights more popular/likely to fill than Saturday overnights?
3. How are trip sales affected by the quarter (Fall, Winter, Spring)?
4. What locations are in demand (trips we should run again) and which are not (trips we won't run again)?
5. How do sign up numbers vary with type of trip (car camping, backpacking, beach)?

Technologies used: Python (Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Seaborn), Tableau, PowerPoint

4. Winner's Circle (Board Game) Strategy Analysis

The goal of this project was to determine the best horses to bet on and devise a stratgey for the board game Winner's Circle. I entered all of the horse cards in the game into a csv with the length of each horses run depending on the dice roll. I wrote a program to simulate a round of Winner's Circle taking into account the rules and restrictions of the game, ran it 100,000 times, and calculated win percentages for every horse. I then investigated whether the difference in win percentage between horses is statistically significant and what features correlate with a high win percentage. 

Technologies Used: Python (Pandas, Seaborn)

Dataset of horses with run lengths for each dice roll (the dice sides are head, helmet, saddle, and horshoe in this game) and additional engineered features:
